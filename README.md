## Machine Learning Project Repo

Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects Repository, a collection of machine learning projects I have done on in the past as a fun learning projects. While these projects were developed some time ago, they reflect my foundational journey in machine learning and cover a variety of use cases and techniques. By uploading them now to GitHub, I aim to document and share these efforts for learning, collaboration, and reference.

### Repository Purpose
This repository serves to:
- Showcase my early work in machine learning, highlighting the techniques and models I explored.
- Provide a resource for anyone interested in learning from these implementations.

### Project Highlights
1. Supervised Learning
- Regression Analysis: Projects focused on predicting continuous variables, such as house price prediction and sales forecasting.
- Classification Tasks: Includes binary and multi-class classification models for datasets like Iris, Titanic survival, and spam email detection.
2. Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering: Implemented K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for customer segmentation and exploratory data analysis.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for visualizing high-dimensional datasets.
3. Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing data, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for data cleaning and understanding.
4. Model Evaluation and Tuning
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE.
- Hyperparameter optimization using grid search and random search techniques.
5. Miscellaneous
- Ensemble Methods: Projects using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), and Bagging models.
- Time Series Analysis: Basic models for forecasting using ARIMA and moving averages.

### Tools and Technologies
- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries and Frameworks: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
